# TrelloClone!

This is my clone for the popular [Trello Web Application](http://www.trello.com).
In this project I aim to recreate Trello using Ruby on Rails to 
create the interface of the app with the database and the standard MVC, 
Backbone.js to optimize the look and feel of the app's interface, and Twitter's
Bootstrap API to create attractive views.
